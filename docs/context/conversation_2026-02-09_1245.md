## Current Task
Fix fake/broken tests identified in critical review

## Issues to Fix
1. webhook.test.ts - deliveryId test is fake (tests nothing)
2. sessions.test.ts - tests copied function, not real implementation
3. merchant.test.ts - doesn't verify timing-safe behavior
4. Missing tests for rate limiting, CORS, body limits

## Next Steps
1. Fix webhook tests to actually call sendWebhook
2. Import real sanitization from routes or test the route directly
3. Verify hash lookup is actually used in merchant tests
